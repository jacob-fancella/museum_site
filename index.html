		<h1>Welcome to the Museum of Natural History!</h1>
		<img src = "images/dinosaur.png" height = 200 width = 300/>	
		<p>Dinosaurs in Their Time is the first permanent exhibition in the world to feature scientifically accurate, immersive environments spanning the Mesozoic Era—the Age of Dinosaurs—arranged chronologically and filled with actively posed original fossil specimens. See dinosaurs like they haven’t been seen in 66 million years! The historic, century-old Dinosaur Hall was closed in Spring 2005 for over two years of renovation and construction, resulting in the spectucular exhibition Dinosaurs in Their Time. The renovated and expanded exhibition illustrates the incredible diversity of life in the Mesozoic Era, placing the dinosaurs in dramatic, scientifically accurate poses amidst the hundreds of plant and animal species that shared their environments. </p>
		<p>Our mission is to protect over 35 million specimens, dating back 4.5 billion years. We are a resource for Pennsylvania teachers and students. We are an authority on the “big picture” of the planet, the natural and the cultural world. The Museum of Natural History tracks the Earth’s biodiversity, because knowing what is out there is the first step to conservation.</p>
