			<h2>Museum Programs</h2>

				<p>September 28, 2013</p>
				<p>9am – 12pm</p>

				<p>This year, discover new exhibits at the NHM! Explore the Spider Pavilion, enjoy a guided tour of Becoming L.A., a Nature Walk in the gardens, and even try your hand at ponding! Come early to enjoy a continental breakfast and enter to win resources for the classroom. Stay afterwards for lunch (on us) and join a workshop with our Museum herpetologist to learn about how you and your students can participate in an L.A. wide research project.</p>

				<p>RSVP to the Open House to receive free parking!</p>
				<p>Visit the Museum!</p>

				<p>Want to bring your students on a field trip to the NHM? Qualified school groups are welcome year round! School Visits are self-guided explorations of the Museum. There are educators available throughout the Museum to answer questions and interact with your students. Additionally, you can sign up for exhibits and guided programs when you request a visit.</p>

			<h2>Museum Tours</h2>
				<p>Request a visit now!</p>
				<p>Bring the Museum to You!</p>

				<p>This is the coolest classroom in the city! Our mobile education programs — the Earthmobile and Seamobile — are unique classrooms, situated in modified tractor-trailers that simulate science research environments. These programs are FREE and available to Los Angeles Unified School District elementary and middle schools, thanks to the generosity of the Maxwell H. Gluck Foundation. Scheduling is based on a district-wide waiting list.</p>
